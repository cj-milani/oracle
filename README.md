# oracle
I-Ching fortune finder

A simple command-line application for getting a quick I-Ching fortune.

Provides a graphical representation of a hexagram, the hexagram number and title, as well as any changing lines (and the resulting hexagram information).

For more information on I-Ching divinations beyond Wikipedia, see James DeKorne's compilation at https://www.jamesdekorne.com/GBCh/GBCh.html.

Ideas for expansion include incorporating true randomness via mic or camera input and a proper GUI.
