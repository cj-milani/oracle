I-Ching fortune finder

This is a simple command-line application for getting a quick I-Ching fortune using Java's random functions instead of having to flip a bunch of coins, mess with yarrow stalks, or kill turtles.

It provides a graphical representation of a hexagram, the hexagram number and title, as well as any changing lines (and the resulting hexagram information).

For more information on I-Ching divinations, see the Wikipedia page and/or James DeKorne's compilation at https://www.jamesdekorne.com/GBCh/GBCh.html. Though it can get a little out there with the Jungian esotericism, it's an admirable passion project that conveniently includes all published translations/interpretations of each hexagram and some history related to what the book might have been for and some thorough instruction on how to use it now.

Ideas for expansion include incorporating true randomness via mic or camera input and, of course, a proper GUI (though I am partial to something like the command line experience for this sort of thing). Also, for the real crypto-teleological solipsists, a "high resonance" feature, which produces a thousand or so hexagrams but reveals a single divination that represents the most common result.
